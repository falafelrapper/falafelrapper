### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zach! Currently I am a full stack web developer who is learning more and more everyday about the technology we use to power our websites and devices. While currently my knowledge is within the realm of web development, I hope to push past and get more into full software development and even game development in the future! I graduated back in March 2024 at UCLA's Full Stack Development Bootcamp, and equipped with that knowledge, I feel great with my skills as a developer.

## Technologies I use:
- Frontend: React, Javascript, Typescript, CSS/SCSS, jQuery, Handlebars
- Backend: Node, Express, REST, SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB), APIs, Python, C#, Java, AWS, GraphQL
- Overall: OOP, Computer Science, MVC, Git, Powershell

## Projects I am currently working on
- Bracket: A social media platform for the fighting game community that utilizes the power of competition to bring the FGC together through tournaments, player/character data, and social functionality
- Property site that I am working on with some graduates from UCLA's program

## Things to get to know me
- Pronouns: he/him
- Hobbies: I play a lot of games in my free time, I love the medium as an art form and genuinely see it as the future of storytelling. When I'm not doing that, you can catch me playing drums for Meishi Smile or Pacific Palace.
